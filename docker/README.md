  elastos/dittobox:10.0.7

### Accessing the ownCloud

By default you can access the ownCloud instance at [https://localhost/](https://localhost/) as long as you have not changed the port binding. The initial user gets set by the environment variables `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, per default it's set to `admin` for username and password.
