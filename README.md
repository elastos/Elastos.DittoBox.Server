### 2. Build ownCloud Agent

With Carrier NDK built,  download **Dittobox** server from the Github address:

```
https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.DittoBox.Server
```

once you have source tree, to make compilation for the target to run on host Linux, need to execute following commands under directory of `${YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT}/build`:

```shell
$ cd YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build
$ mkdir linux
$ cd linux
$ cmake -DCARRIER_SDK_PATH=YOUR-PREBUILT-SDK-INSTALL-PATH ../..
$ make
```
Also to build distribution with specific build type **Debug/Release**, as well as with customised install location of distributions, run the following commands:

```shell
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOUR-INSTALL-PATH \
        -DCARRIER_SDK_PATH=YOUR-PREBUILT-SDK-INSTALL-PATH ../..
$ make
$ make install
```
Eventually,  run the following command to release distribution package for your pre-release tests or even to customers.

```bash
$ make dist
```

## Deploy & Run
